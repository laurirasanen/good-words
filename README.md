# Good words

There are many public lists for bad (obscene) words used for hindering malicious actors online, such as:
- https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words
- https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words

However I couldn't find a decent list of positive words, so I made one.  
This list is intended as a tool for approximating the amount of good vibes in your data set.
